# QInvasion
v0.1

_By KaadmY_

QuakeC is based off [this release](https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/id1qc.zip)

## Description

Hold back waves of monsters to keep the installation you've been assigned to safe.

You lose when the monsters destroy the objective. You win when you successfully hold back all the waves of monsters.

Dying resets your inventory, so don't die!

## Usage

Place or link the _qinvasion_ directory alongside the _id1_ directory in your DarkPlaces basedir.

Run DarkPlaces, then go to _Options->Browse Mods_ and select "qinvasion". An alternate way is to add "-game qinvasion" to the command line or launcher when starting DarkPlaces.

## Credits

- _id Software_, for creating Quake and the idTech2 engine.

- _LordHavoc_, for the idTech2 port, DarkPlaces.

- _KaadmY_, source changes and invasion maps in this mod

## Misc

### CVars

There are some new CVars in this mod which are explained below

- _invasion_: defaults to 1 (on), and when disabled should play the same as vanilla Quake. Don't expect everything to work when disabling this, though!

- _invasion_multiplier_: Monster count multiplier. 1.0 is normal amount of monsters, 0.5 halves, and 2.0 doubles.

## License

Source and maps are all licensed GPLv3+

See file _LICENSE.md_ for more information

## Notes

- While this was tested with DarkPlaces, any other port should also work, as this shouldn't use any DarkPlaces-specific features not available in other engines.

- This is currently my largest Quake mod, so don't expect it to be perfect.

- This is also my first Quake1 map ever :)
